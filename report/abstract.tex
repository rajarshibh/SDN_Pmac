The explosion of mobile devices have led to tremendous demand for network services and bandwidth. This has necessitated the development of intelligent networks which allows dynamic reconfiguration based upon channel conditions, sprectrum availability and other user defined conditions. This requires a cross layer visibility into the protocol stack and a centralized view of the network for optimal decision making. In order to provide dynamic adjustment and reconfigurability of MAC protocols, we present the PMAC framework. The framework focusses on defining MAC layer abstractions and providing interfaces for event driven programmability using Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles. It also provides a mechanism for the devices to interact with the centralized controller by piggybacking protocol messages on beacon frames to avoid creating a new messaging system. These messages are processed by the Access Points before sending it to the centralized controller through SDN control channel. We assume that NIC vendors provide the stated APIs and allow different MAC protocols to be loaded at runtime. As part of this paper we extend the open source Glomosim network simulator to support dynmaic switching of protocols and showcase a proof-of concept application of changing MAC protcols according to hidden terminal and exposed terminal scenarios.
